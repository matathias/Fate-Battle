# Fate-Battle

This is a turn-based tactics game I wrote for use in Caltech's "Ditch Day". Confirmed to run on Windows 7, 8, and 10. Have not created a version for Mac or Linux.

For a description of the classes and their abilities, look here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11S_JtkzL3OlMbtI2ci-9Q5RiJdMPdXzz9CG5OhVwC3Y/edit?usp=sharing

GUI was created using QtCreator.

This project was whipped up within about a month and a half using only my free time while still attending college, so excuse some of the sloppiness...
